# PyBer Ridesharing Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to yield insights into various metrics of interest from PyBer classified by city type. Analyzing by city type (urban, suburban, rural) will allow us to highlight differences in ridesharing outcomes in a general sense, and will empower PyBer to make the best possible decisions with respect to fares in the respective city types.

## Results

Observing the data, it is clear that the most rides and fairs, that is overall traffic, are highest in urban localities. This is unsurprising, but does not tell the entire story. While urban areas have the most traffic, the distances covered are relatively small compared to the other localities. This can be confirmed by the average fare per ride column, where urban has the lowest. This trend also holds true for the last column, average fare per driver.

## Summary
From an executive perspective, maintaining a focus on urban localities makes the most sense, as these areas yield the greatest amount of fares. Assuming the share claimed by PyBer on each fare stays constant, more fares of a lower amount seem to yield more revenue than less fares that are larger. However from the perspective of PyBer employees, there is something to be said for the lower traffic localities. There are fewer drivers which means fares will be higher, resulting in the highest average fares per driver in rural areas. With more data on the frequency of rides it would be easier to see if rural areas are truly worth focusing on. It could be in certain situations (e.g. inclement weather) that the right driver could make a lot of money. But again, how often do these situations arise? Customers will more than likely pay extra money to get home over rural roads in a blizzard but the relative incidence of this situation (to say nothing of the increased liability to employees) could mean that urban areas 'nickel and dime' past rural ones in terms of profitability.
